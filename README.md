# Metorik.com - Coming Soon Page

**This is the coming soon / announcement page for [**Metorik**](https://metorik.com).**

With little work you can easily repurpose this for your own app's coming soon or landing page.

**Important note:** There is a tag in the HTML head to stop indexing by search engines. You'll likely need to remove this before publishing.

It's very fast and could be even faster but I love [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) so I wanted to use it to handle email signups & sharing.

It uses [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com) for the email signup - you can replace the URL used with your own one or change the code in `scripts.js` to use a different provider.

Of course, everything else will need to be changed too, including:

* Copy
* Feature list
* Logo
* Footer
* Share links
* Meta tags
* MailChimp URL
